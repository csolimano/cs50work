## Project Synopsis
With PolitiTracker, I set out to create a website that would increase accessibility to information about one's congressional representative.
Given an address, PolitiTracker retrieves and displays:

* The representative's biographical information
* Their most recent tweets
* Their most recent votes
* A synopsis of their most recent cycle's campaign financing
* Several methods to contact them
